Description: User level public file sharing via WebDAV or ObexFTP
 MATE user share is a small tool that binds together various free
 software projects to bring easy to use user-level file sharing to the
 masses.
 .
 The program is meant to run in the background when the user is logged
 in, and when file sharing is enabled a webdav server is started that
 shares the $HOME/Public folder. The share is then published to all
 computers on the local network using mDNS/rendezvous, so that it shows
 up in the Network location in GNOME.
 .
 The dav server used is Apache, so you need that installed. Avahi or 
 Howl is used for mDNS support, so you need to have that installed and
 mDNSResolver running.

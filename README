This is the repository of debian/ folders to build Debian and Ubuntu
packages for MATE, for development and testing purposes.

You can use debian/ folders with standard tarballs from:
    * https://pub.mate-desktop.org/releases/1.22/
    * https://pub.mate-desktop.org/releases/themes/3.22/

Or you can build from git master branches. In this case you need to have
these folders:

    ~/mate/debian-packages      (this repo)

    ~/mate/atril
    ~/mate/caja                 (mate packages)
    ~/mate/mate-panel

Launch build.py from ~/mate. Example:

    user@test ~/mate/ $ debian-packages/build.py caja

The source folder will be copied on /tmp/, debian folder will be hacked
to build without tarball, and result .debs will be put on ~/mate.

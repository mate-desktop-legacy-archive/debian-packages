This is the repository of debian/ folders to build Debian and Ubuntu
packages for MATE, for development and testing purposes.

You can use debian/ folders with standard tarballs from
http://pub.mate-desktop.org/releases/1.14/,

Or you can build from git master branches. In this case you need to have
these folders:

    ~/mate/debian-packages      (this repo)

    ~/mate/atril
    ~/mate/caja                 (mate packages)
    ~/mate/mate-panel

Launch build.py from ~/mate. Example:

    user@test ~/mate/ $ debian-packages/build.py caja

The source folder will be copied on /tmp/, debian folder will be hacked
to build without tarball, and result .debs will be put on ~/mate.



If you want to build packages with GTK3, use setgtk.py to edit debian/
folders forcing them to using all GTK3 dependencies:

    ./setgtk.py --all --gtk3
